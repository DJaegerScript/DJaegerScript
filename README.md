### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a software engineer, I recognized my interest in web development when I tried editing my Blogspot theme in 2014. Later, in 2019, I started studying software engineering through academic coursework and self-study. I have gained proficiency in several programming languages since then. 

Additionally, I also deepened my understanding of software testing and automation from my prior internship and software infrastructure from my campus projects.

As I said before, during my time as a college student, I had many campus projects and I led some of them. These projects have provided me with valuable experience in project management, collaboration, and problem-solving.
