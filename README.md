# About Me

I’m passionate about software engineering, especially if it means making an impact on
business-related problems. I’ve been doing software engineering since 2019 and professionally
dive into the real world in 2020.

Since my first time engineering software, I’ve learned and applied many technologies, principles,
and thoughts from my seniors, colleagues, and friends.

During my studies in college, I’ve led several IT projects for an event held by my faculty. Besides
that, I’ve frequently taken on external campus projects.

Still, It is a long way to go for me. Thus, I am ready for a bigger challenge as a software engineer
to make an impact on your organization’s business.
